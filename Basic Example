Although there are many code interpreters for Prolog, my personal favorite is SWISH. It is free to use and works on any computer. 
The link to SWISH is in the README.md file. Just click on "Program" button when it starts up.

In this example, we will use the 3 predicates demonstrated below.

Naruto is a ninja.
All ninjas are stealthy.
Therefore, Naruto is stealthy.

These 3 predicates are expressed in deductive logic which is simple to understand. 
In Prolog, the first two statements would be written in the knowledge base as:

ninja(naruto).               //fact
stealthy(X) :- ninja(X).     //rule

At the end of each statement, a period must be placed at the end whether it's a fact, rule, or query. 
The ":-" on line 14 is known as the "turn style operator."
Some ways to interpret line 14 are "All ninjas are stealthy" or "If it is true that X is a ninja, then it is true that X is stealthy."
In Prolog, any symbol that begins with an uppercase letter is considered a variable.

Now that the predicates are stated, we can write a query to confirm if Naruto is stealthy.
To do this, we write:

?- stealthy(naruto).          //query

Once we run the program, it will return the value as "true." 
If we were to write a different name that was not mentioned in the predicate such as:

?- stealthy(sasuke).          //query

The program would return the value as "false" since that name was not mentioned in the knowledge base.
