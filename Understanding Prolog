Before we start writing some examples, we need to understand some concepts of Prolog.
Prolog is short for "Programming with logic."
There are 3 basic constructs in Prolog known as Facts, Rules, and Queries.

Facts are used to state information that is always true.
Rules state information that relate the facts with one another.

Facts and rules are known as clauses.
These clauses are in a knowledge base.
The knowledge base contains relationships that are used to ask questions.
Queries are used to ask questions about the information stored in the knowledge base.

Most programs that deal with Prolog require a full stop that is interpreted as a period.
If this is not displayed, Prolog will not start working on the query.

Also, we do not type in the prompt symbol ?- because it is already displayed on the query.
This symbol is displayed when the Prolog interpreter is waiting to evaluate a query.

When we write a rule, we use the :- symbol and it should be read as "if" or "is implied by."
The information on the left side is called the head of the rule and the part on the right side is called the body. 
By doing so, Prolog knows that the body is followed by the information in the knowledge base,
          therefore, it can infer the head of the statement.
Since we used the :- symbol, the rule is known as modus ponens.

In Prolog many symbols have a meaning such as:
A simicolon ; is the Prolog symbol for "or."
A comma , is another way of saying "and."

In Prolog, any word beginning with an upper-case letter is known as a variable. 
Variables are used as placeholders for information.
