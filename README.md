# Prolog-Introduction
This repository contains some explanations that should help the user learn Prolog. This logic programming language plays an important role in Artificial Intelligence. In Prolog, logic is expressed as facts and rules that are carried out by running queries.

# Key Features:
1. Unification: In order to understand this, one must ask themselves if the given terms can be made to represent the same structure that is being applied.
2. Backtracking: When a task fails, the prolog traces backwards and tries to satisfy the previous task that it was asked to do. 
3. Recursion: This is the process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly. The corresponding function is known as a recursive function. The idea is to represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller problems and add one or more conditions that stop the recursion.

# Advantages: 
1. Easy to build database.
2. Pattern matching is simple since search is recursion based.
3. It contains built in list handling which makes prolog easier to play with any algorithm that involves lists such as sequences and trees.

# Disadvantages:
1. Sometimes input and output is not easy.
2. Prolog doesn't support graphics.
3. LISP (another programming language) has better input and output features than Prolog.
